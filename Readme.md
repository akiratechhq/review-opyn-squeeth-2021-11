## Executive summary

This report represents the results of the engagement with **Opyn** to review **Opyn Squeeth**.

The review was conducted over the course of **2 weeks** from **November 29 to December 10, 2021**. A total of **15 person-days** were spent reviewing the code.

The code is well written, and the design is thoroughly thought out. There are unit and integration tests, and the code is gas efficient.

The team has been very helpful in guiding our understanding of the design and its implementation - especially since some of the constructs are somewhat novel in the crypto space.

### Week 1

We started by reviewing the provided documentation and the initial kickoff recording during the first week.

Within the first few days of the review, we identified an issue with the way `ERC721` tokens are handled and raised it with the team.

It became clear that this issue had been identified in a previous code review by the ToB team, and we were given access to their report.

### Week 2

We kept close contact with the Squeeth team on an almost daily basis. We went through the mechanics for funding rate, vault liquidations, the incentives that will keep the Mark Price within certain bounds relative to Index, Crab Strategy, and different parameters for the funding period.

In the second week we reviewied patches that addressed some of the issues that were found in the code (by us and previously by ToB team).

We expressed our concerns to the team regarding the financial constructs involved in the Squeeth product - we recommend seeking further review of the code and high-level mechanics from a third party that is specialized in this area. While the code might be correct from a security standpoint, we cannot guarantee that the game-theoretical model is going to perform as predicted in all conditions.

## Scope

The initial review focused on the [Opyn Squeeth](git@github.com:opynfinance/squeeth-monorepo.git) repository, identified by the commit hash `474413cbba52708c953a23a500acc4194735c87b`.

We focused on manually reviewing the codebase, searching for security issues such as, but not limited to, re-entrancy problems, transaction ordering, block timestamp dependency, exception handling, call stack depth limitation, integer overflow/underflow, self-destructible contracts, unsecured balance, use of origin, costly gas patterns, architectural problems, code readability.

## Issues


### [EIP-721 standard is not implemented correctly; can lead to loss of funds for users;](https://github.com/akiratechhq/review-opyn-squeeth-2021-11/issues/1)
![Issue status: Fixed](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Status&message=Fixed&color=5AC8FA&style=flat-square) ![Major](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Severity&message=Major&color=ff3b30&style=flat-square)

**Description**

Edit: issue fixed in [opynfinance/squeeth-monorepo#630](https://github.com/opynfinance/squeeth-monorepo/pull/630).

The `ShortPowerPerp` contract is used to generate an NFT, which represents the user's ownership of a vault within the Squeeth platform:


[code/packages/hardhat/contracts/core/ShortPowerPerp.sol#L38-L46](https://github.com/akiratechhq/review-opyn-squeeth-2021-11/blob/334d87dd005336f60b0e9a767f16910b076e404e/code/packages/hardhat/contracts/core/ShortPowerPerp.sol#L38-L46)
```solidity
    /**
     * @notice mint new NFT
     * @dev autoincrement tokenId starts at 1
     * @param _recipient recipient address for NFT
     */
    function mintNFT(address _recipient) external onlyController returns (uint256 tokenId) {
        // mint NFT
        _mint(_recipient, (tokenId = nextId++));
    }
```

The issue is that the function uses OpenZeppelin's `ERC721._mint` function instead of `_safeMint`. The difference between these two functions is that `_safeMint` ensures that the `onERC721Received` function is called on the destination address to handle the receipt of the NFT (for non-contract addresses this is a no-op):

```solidity
    /**
     * @dev Same as {xref-ERC721-_safeMint-address-uint256-}[`_safeMint`], with an additional `data` parameter which is
     * forwarded in {IERC721Receiver-onERC721Received} to contract recipients.
     */
    function _safeMint(address to, uint256 tokenId, bytes memory _data) internal virtual {
        _mint(to, tokenId);
        require(_checkOnERC721Received(address(0), to, tokenId, _data), "ERC721: transfer to non ERC721Receiver implementer");
    }
```

When transferring Uniswap V3 LP tokens, since they implement the EIP-721 standard, the `safeTransferFrom` function should be called instead (the `NonfungiblePositionManager` contract extends OpenZeppeling's `EIP721` contract):


[code/packages/hardhat/contracts/core/Controller.sol#L800](https://github.com/akiratechhq/review-opyn-squeeth-2021-11/blob/334d87dd005336f60b0e9a767f16910b076e404e/code/packages/hardhat/contracts/core/Controller.sol#L800)
```solidity
        INonfungiblePositionManager(uniswapPositionManager).transferFrom(_account, address(this), _uniTokenId);
```

A user can deposit Uniswap V3 LP positions as collateral in a vault by calling `Controller.depositUniPositionToken`:


[code/packages/hardhat/contracts/core/Controller.sol#L344](https://github.com/akiratechhq/review-opyn-squeeth-2021-11/blob/334d87dd005336f60b0e9a767f16910b076e404e/code/packages/hardhat/contracts/core/Controller.sol#L344)
```solidity
    function depositUniPositionToken(uint256 _vaultId, uint256 _uniTokenId) external notPaused nonReentrant {
```

According to the [EIP-721 specification](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721#specification) a contract that receives NFT tokens should implement the `onERC721Received` function:

```solidity
/// @dev Note: the ERC-165 identifier for this interface is 0x150b7a02.
interface ERC721TokenReceiver {
    /// @notice Handle the receipt of an NFT
    /// @dev The ERC721 smart contract calls this function on the recipient
    ///  after a `transfer`. This function MAY throw to revert and reject the
    ///  transfer. Return of other than the magic value MUST result in the
    ///  transaction being reverted.
    ///  Note: the contract address is always the message sender.
    /// @param _operator The address which called `safeTransferFrom` function
    /// @param _from The address which previously owned the token
    /// @param _tokenId The NFT identifier which is being transferred
    /// @param _data Additional data with no specified format
    /// @return `bytes4(keccak256("onERC721Received(address,address,uint256,bytes)"))`
    ///  unless throwing
    function onERC721Received(address _operator, address _from, uint256 _tokenId, bytes _data) external returns(bytes4);
}
```

        â should revert when trying to mint the same amount with smaller collateral (75ms)
      3 minutes after eth price spiked
        â index price is updated if requesting with period 180
        â vaults becomes unsafe (56ms)
        â should revert when trying to mint with same amount of collateral as before (69ms)
    Scenario: ETH/DAI price crashes 50%
      1 second after eth price crash (Similar to the state created by flashloan)
        â index price is updated if requesting with period 1
        â vaults is still safe (because price moves down) (71ms)
        â should revert if trying to mint more squeeth (72ms)
      1 minutes after eth price crashed

      â should revert is slippage is too high (97ms)
      â should revert if end price is lower than limit (94ms)
      â should open new vault and sell squeeth, receive weth in return (105ms)
      â should add ShortHelper as an operator
      â should add collateral to an existing vault and sell squeeth, receive weth in return (100ms)
      â should revert if a random address tries to mint and sell squeeth on someone elses vault
      â should revert if collateral amount put down is dust (69ms)
      â should revert if user does not put enough collateral (72ms)
      â should open new vault and sell squeeth, receive eth at the end (106ms)
      â should revert if trying to short more from the current vault (75ms)
    Checking eth payable reverts
      â should revert if ETH is sent from a contract other than weth or the controller
    Close short position
      â should revert if a random user to withdraw ETH from someone elses vault
      â should revert if trying to partially close a position using squeeth and not weth
      â should revert if trying to partially close a position using weth and non-squeeth
      â should revert if slippage is too high
      â should revert if end price is too high (46ms)
      â should revert when leaving vault with dust collateral and debt (93ms)
      â should revert if remove too much collateral vs debt bought back (90ms)
